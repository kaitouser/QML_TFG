# About the project

Quantum embedding became an interesting topic inside the world of data compression and classification.
This field tries to represent classical data via quantum features, using differents properties of quantum physics like superposition or entanglement.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with the different algorithms that are being studied in this field, and implement them using the available libraries for them.
