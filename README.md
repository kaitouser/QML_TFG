# About the project

Quantum embedding became an interesting topic inside the world of data compression and classification.
This field tries to represent classical data via quantum features, using differents properties of quantum physics like superposition or entanglement.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with the different algorithms that are being studied in this field, and implement them using the available libraries for them.

First, we have to create a notebook using the Jupyter webapp we just installed.

Now, here are the command lines required to install the packages in our notebook:
~~~
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install qiskit=='0.46.0'
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
pip install qiskit[visualization]
~~~
